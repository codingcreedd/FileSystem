FileSystem Project

A Java-based File System project with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using JFrame in NetBeans 23. This project implements key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and utilizes various data structures, including:

    Arrays
    Linked Lists
    Stacks
    Queues
    Trees (specifically AVL Trees)

üîß Features

    Command-Line Interface (CLI):
        Mimics a file system's command prompt.
        Supports commands like mkdir, cd, ls, touch, rmv, and more.
    Graphical User Interface (GUI):
        Displays the current file system structure dynamically.
        Provides input fields and output areas for easy interaction.
    Data Structures:
        Linked Lists for managing file and directory entries.
        Stacks for tracking navigation paths.
        Queues for task-based file creation/deletion.
        AVL Trees for efficient file/directory lookup and organization.
    Object-Oriented Design:
        Classes such as FileSystem, Directory, File, Entry, Navigation, and Commands encapsulate logic cleanly.

üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Java
    IDE: NetBeans 23
    GUI: Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JTextArea, JTextField, JTree, etc.)
